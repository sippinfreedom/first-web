    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I'm a Management Information Systems student with a computer science minor at UMass Lowell with a passion
		 for building/fixing things - From websites to business ideas. By day, I attempt to read/learn as much as I can; by night (and weekends),
		 I'm a waiter and digital marketer pushing closer to my goals.</p>

    <h2>My Weekend Hustle</h2>
    <p>Every Friday through Sundays, I waiter tables. It's fast paced which I love. I also run a social media marketing campgains on the side which I help

    <h2>Dream Cars</h2>
    <p>My #1 dream car is the <strong>Porsche 992 Turbo S</strong> â€” it's timeless design, clean, and brutal speed.  
       Recently, my boss let me borrow his <strong>G - Wagon G63 AMG</strong> for the weekend. Unreal experience â€” 
       now it's been my #2 dream since.</p>
